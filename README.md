For the analysis I have used 2 datasets
Animee - Title ,Genres, Rank,Popularity , Score, Episodes,Episode Length , Release Date
Ratings - Title ,Genres, Rank,Popularity , Score, Episodes,Episode Length , Release Date
The project "AnimeReview: MySQL Driven Analysis of User Feedback for Anime Ratings" explores the vast anime dataset from the Anime List database, aiming to uncover insights about anime ratings, rankings, genres, and other details. The primary problem statement involves understanding the factors that influence anime ratings and identifying trends within the anime landscape.
